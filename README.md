This program implements Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm using Python, allowing users to upload images and determine whether the uploaded image contains a cat or a dog. The program utilizes a pre-trained CNN model to analyze and classify these images. Various tools such as TensorFlow or PyTorch will be used to implement CNN models. With this program, users will be able to confidently verify whether the uploaded image is a cat or a dog.
